# TODOs and ideas

- keep subtitle and id separated
- add `\once \override Score.RehearsalMark.break-visibility = ##(#t #t #f)` to \markDaCapo
- use biblatex/biber to print an optional bibliography
- maybe directives such as “poco f” and “p assai” should be centered on the dynamics letter
- generate cover for KDP automatically
